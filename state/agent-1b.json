The tulle is such high quality - not cheap or scratchy at all. The draping is so flattering and hides all the areas I'm self-conscious about while still looking elegant and sophisticated. I'm 5'4\" and about 160lbs, ordered a large and it fit like it was made for me. The shipping was faster than expected (only 4 days!) and it came in beautiful packaging. I've already recommended it to three friends. One small note - it does need to be steamed when it arrives, but that's to be expected with tulle. Absolutley worth every penny and I felt like a million bucks at the wedding!",

I took off one star because it is quite sheer - I had to purchase a slip dress seperately which added to the overall cost. Also, I'm 5'8\" and while the length was fine with heels, anyone taller might find it a bit short. The customer service was excellent when I had questions about sizing before ordering. They responded within a few hours which I really appreciated. Overall very happy with my purchase and the dress photographs beautifully. My photographer actually asked where I got it!",

The way the tulle drapes creates such an elegant, romantic look - my husband couldn't stop telling me how beautiful I looked! The quality is exceptional, especially for the price point. I've bought designer dresses that cost three times as much with lower quality fabric. It's true to size (I ordered a medium and I'm usually a size 8) and the length was perfect with 3-inch heels. It did arrive with some wrinkles but a quick steam and it looked perfect. The only tiny thing is that it's more delicate than I expected, so you do have to be carefull not to snag it. But honestly, that's what makes it look so expensive and elegant. I'm already looking at other dresses from this collection!",

      "text": "I bought this dress for my son's graduation ceremony and it was perfect for the occasion. The draped tulle gives it such a sophisticated look without being too formal. I will say it runs slightly large - I'm normally between a small and medium and the small would have been better, but the medium still worked with a belt. The quality is really good, the tulle is soft and doesn't feel cheap at all. Shipping took about 5 days which was fine. My only real complaint is that it does need the right undergarments because it is somewhat sheer, but that's pretty standard for this type of dress. I felt elegant and age-apropriate (I'm 52) which can be hard to find. Would definately recommend to friends!",
